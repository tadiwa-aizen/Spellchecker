Analysis of Questions & Proposed Solutions
Questions 2-3: Word-level vs Character-level Models
What they're asking:

Question 2: Clarification on "word-level model" terminology
Question 3: Whether cross-language testing was done (e.g., testing isiXhosa words on isiZulu model)
Current situation:

Two types of models exist:
Character-level models (*UModel.arpa) - trained on space-separated characters
Word-level models (*Model.arpa) - trained on whole words
Currently, each language is only tested on its own model
Question 4: Real-world Spellchecker Testing
The Problem: Current testing compares correct vs incorrect words side-by-side, but real spellcheckers only see one word at a time and must determine if it's correct or not.

Proposed Solution: Create a threshold-based detection system that:

Scores individual words against the model
Flags words below a certain threshold as "potentially misspelled"
Determines optimal threshold through analysis of correct vs incorrect word distributions
Question 5: Test Data Creation
What they're asking: How were the misspelled words created? Were they:

Real typos from users?
Artificially generated?
Created with a "spelling wrecker" tool?
Proposed Solution: Document the test data creation methodology and potentially create a spelling wrecker tool to generate realistic typos.

Question 6: Cross-Model Testing Matrix
What they're asking: Test all language test files against all language models to create a confusion matrix.

Proposed Solution: Create a matrix showing:

              isiZulu Model | isiXhosa Model | isiNdebele Model | siSwati Model
isiZulu_test      100%      |      ?%        |       ?%         |     ?%
isiXhosa_test      ?%       |     70%        |       ?%         |     ?%
isiNdebele_test    ?%       |      ?%        |      60%         |     ?%
siSwati_test       ?%       |      ?%        |       ?%         |    90%
Question 7: Corpus Files Used
Answer: Based on the directory structure:

Raw corpora: raw_corpora/*.txt
Cleaned corpora: cleaned_corpora/*.txt
Character-level corpora: character_corpora/*UCorpus.txt
Question 8: Larger Test Dataset
What they're asking: Expand from 20 test cases per language to:

3x 20 = 60 cases per language (for averaging)
OR use 1000+ words with automated wrecker tool
Proposed Solution: Build a spelling wrecker tool that generates realistic typos and expand test dataset significantly.

Question 9: Threshold Analysis
What they're asking: Analyze score distributions to find optimal detection thresholds for real-world use.

Proposed Solution:

Score all correct words from corpus
Score all incorrect words from test set
Plot distributions
Find optimal threshold that maximizes detection while minimizing false positives
My Proposed Implementation Plan
I would create a spec to implement the following features:

Feature 1: Cross-Model Testing Matrix
Modify run_spell_tests.py to test each language's test file against all 4 models
Generate a confusion matrix showing cross-language performance
Identify if models can detect misspellings in related languages
Feature 2: Spelling Wrecker Tool
Build a tool that generates realistic typos:
Character substitutions (common keyboard mistakes)
Character deletions
Character insertions
Character transpositions
Phonetic errors specific to African languages
Generate 1000+ test cases per language
Feature 3: Threshold-Based Real Spellchecker
Analyze score distributions for correct vs incorrect words
Determine optimal detection thresholds
Build a standalone spellchecker that:
Takes a single word as input
Returns: "correct" or "possibly misspelled" with confidence score
Suggests corrections (using edit distance + model scoring)
Feature 4: Enhanced Reporting & Analysis
Statistical analysis of results
Visualization of score distributions
Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1-score)
Comparison of character-level vs word-level models
Would you like me to create a spec for any of these features? I'd recommend starting with Feature 3 (Threshold-Based Real Spellchecker) since that addresses the core concern in Question 4 and 9, and is the most practical for real-world use.
